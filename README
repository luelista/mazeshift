LEVEL EDITING

Editing or creating levels is quite easy. The map of a level is defined by a plain text file containing an ASCII art representation of the map. If you happen to use the Emacs editor, the definitions for your init.el / .emacs provided in the section "EMACS HELPERS" should be useful.

Maps must have the following directory structure:

levels/
        mapN/
                map.txt                 <-- this contains the ASCII level map
                script.lua              <-- this contains level specific behavior
                bg.png                  <-- background image
                some-image.png          <-- (*)

(*) you can put any number of arbitrarily named image files in your map folder
    and refer to it with lvlimg("some-image") from your script.lua

If no background image (bg.png) exists, a black background is used. If bg.png is
smaller/bigger than 1024x600 px, it will be repeated/cropped. To find nice backgrounds, you could have a look around Subtle Patterns [4], where we got most of them.

The easiest was to create script.lua is to copy it from an existing level. It has 
to be a Lua script file which returns an object of this structure:

levelhandler:
{
        onLoad = function (self) ... end,
        onCollision = function (self, direction, mapchar, player, x, y, playerIndex) ... end,
        players = { ... },
        imagemap = { ... }
}

The players and imagemap objects are mandatory (but imagemap may be an empty object). The
event handler methods onLoad and onCollision are optional.

EMACS HELPERS

Some helpers for users of GNU/Emacs editor [5].

(defun lua/bindkey-recompile ()
  "Bind <F5> to `recompile'."
  (local-set-key (kbd "<f5>") 'recompile)
  (linum-mode)
)
(add-hook 'lua-mode-hook 'lua/bindkey-recompile)

(define-derived-mode asciimap-mode prog-mode "ASCIIMap"
       "Major mode for editing ASCII game level maps.

       Depending on what you're doing, you might want to enable some of the following minor modes, too:

       - overwrite-mode (press insert key)
       - artist-mode
       
       "
       (setq buffer-face-mode-face '(:family "Print Char 21" :width ultra-expanded :height 70))
       (buffer-face-mode)       
   (setq-local comment-start "!! ")
   (setq-local comment-start-skip "!!+\\s-*")
)

CHEAT CODES

There are a few cheat codes in the game. To use them, press escape (pause menu) and then one of the following keys:

+ turn up the light
- turn down the light
# show the full map
